This study investigates the effectiveness of an underprivileged school donation web application in addressing the issue of hunger among children in Sri Lanka during an economic crisis. The research highlights the challenges faced by the current food donation system, such as limited resources and logistical difficulties. However, it also demonstrates that the system has positively impacted the health and nutrition of school children, emphasizing the importance of continued support and investment in similar programs.

The study recommends further research to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the food donation system on child health and educational outcomes. It also emphasizes the need for strategies to improve the sustainability and scalability of the program. Engaging with local communities and stakeholders is highlighted as a crucial aspect of designing and implementing effective food donation programs.

Overall, the research provides significant insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers working to address food insecurity and malnutrition in underprivileged communities. It shows that food donation programs can positively impact child health and nutrition, but ongoing investment, monitoring, and evaluation are necessary for their effectiveness and sustainability.

By launching this underprivileged school donation web application, the research aims to contribute to the solution of childhood hunger in Sri Lanka, with the overarching goal of ensuring that no children in the country suffer from hunger. The findings and recommendations from this study can guide future research and policy initiatives in reducing the prevalence of malnutrition and food insecurity, not only in Sri Lanka but also in similar contexts.
